Things get mixed...

Create one kind, one app and several users for that app.

Go to: http://localhost:3000/site

In the last table with "Here the kinds_controller is embedded"
you should have one line, with one app, 
click in the Apps column, on the App with users.

The apps for this kind shows in a nested AS list... with their users in one column.

When you click in the users column, on the user list...

The users shows but in the first embedded AS: "Here the apps_controller is embedded"

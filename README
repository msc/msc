RJS Error with an Embedded controller
=====================================

To recreate the "embedded" problem, you just have to go to
http://localhost:3000/site

and then click in the Kind column for one app! (same if you click in the
user column) Then you got the RJS error!

RJS Error with a 1:n then n:1
=============================

For the second problem (1:n n:1):

You should first create an apps with a kind and an user (with name...):
go to /apps, Create New, enter 3 names for kind, app and user, for
example: K7, A7, U7; Create

then go to /users, click on the Apps column of U7 (thus, A7) Details for
Apps for U7 shows... and then you can click on the kind column (K7)...

Update K7 shows... but with the RJS error!

RJS error with Create New
=========================

Go to /site
Find an app that has no Kind or User (if necessary, you can create an
app with just a name before)
In the Kind or User column, you will find "Create New": click on that
link, the Create sub-form shows well, but with the RJS error!

Well well, click 2 times on OK, you can enter some data (user or kind)
but when you click on the Create button you have one more time the RJS
error, this time with a different message...

And at the end, you cannot create another, it doesn't work!!
